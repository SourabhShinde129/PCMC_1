The NullPointerException you’re encountering suggests that when you attempt to access getProposalDetails() on CRBLeadData, the CRBLeadData object itself is null, leading to this crash. This can happen in situations where the API response is technically successful (i.e., HTTP 200 status), but the response body does not contain the expected data.

Here’s a breakdown of why this may happen and steps to handle it:

Possible Reasons for Null Data

	1.	API Response with Empty Data: The API returns a success status (e.g., 200 OK) but the data field is empty or null.
	2.	Incorrect Mapping: The JSON response structure might not align with your data model (e.g., CRBLeadData), causing deserialization issues where fields are left as null.
	3.	Parsing Issue: If the response JSON is malformed or the parser encounters unexpected fields, it may set your model object to null.
	4.	Backend Issue: Sometimes, even though the API is technically reachable and responds, the backend may have errors or missing data for specific requests.

Steps to Handle This Scenario

	1.	Check for Null Values Before Accessing Data:
Add a null check for the CRBLeadData object before accessing any of its fields or methods. This way, you can handle cases where the data is missing without crashing the app.

// Check if crbLeadData is null
if (crbLeadData != null && crbLeadData.getProposalDetails() != null) {
    // Safe to access proposal details
    List<ProposalDetails> proposalDetails = crbLeadData.getProposalDetails();
    // Your logic here
} else {
    // Handle the case where data is missing
    Log.e("CRB_Leads", "Data or proposal details are null");
    // Optionally, show a message to the user
}


	2.	Check API Response for Data Existence:
Inspect the raw response from the API using logs or debugging tools to confirm whether data is missing in the response or there’s an issue in deserialization.
	3.	Validate the JSON Parsing:
If you’re using a JSON library like Gson or Moshi, make sure that the data structure in your model (CRBLeadData) matches the response format. This can help avoid null fields if the JSON keys don’t align with your model.
	4.	Handle API Errors:
If there’s a possibility of a backend issue, you could add error handling in the API call by checking the response structure or status fields (if any) returned by the API. Sometimes APIs include a status or message field that can help determine if data is missing.

Example of Handling API Null Response Gracefully

Here’s an example of how to handle the response with Volley in your case:

StringRequest stringRequest = new StringRequest(Request.Method.GET, url,
    response -> {
        try {
            // Parse the response
            Gson gson = new Gson();
            CRBLeadData crbLeadData = gson.fromJson(response, CRBLeadData.class);

            if (crbLeadData != null && crbLeadData.getProposalDetails() != null) {
                // Use data safely
                List<ProposalDetails> proposalDetails = crbLeadData.getProposalDetails();
                // Your processing logic
            } else {
                // Log or display an error indicating that data is missing
                Log.e("API Response", "CRBLeadData or ProposalDetails is null");
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            Log.e("API Response", "Error parsing JSON", e);
        }
    },
    error -> {
        Log.e("API Response", "Volley error", error);
        // Handle network errors or other unexpected issues
    }
);

This approach will prevent your app from crashing when the API response is empty or malformed and will give you the flexibility to handle such cases more effectively.
